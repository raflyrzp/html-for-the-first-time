# Hello World! 👋🌐

> From my very first steps in HTML and CSS to building my first website — a journey that began with one YouTube video.

## 📖 The Backstory

In **2021**, I stumbled upon a YouTube tutorial titled **"Tutorial Membuat Web Company Profile Menggunakan HTML dan CSS | LENGKAP"** by [Dzulfikar Nurfikri](https://youtu.be/86FHw_iJlHM?si=I7zNsOBZD_KO7VQH).  
Out of curiosity, I clicked play... and unknowingly stepped into the world of **web development**.

The tutorial guided me from the very basics of HTML and CSS, teaching me how to:

- Structure a webpage with HTML elements like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- Style the page using CSS
- Add headings, paragraphs, images, and links

By following along, I created my **first actual website**, and it blew my mind.

## 💻 What’s This Repo?

This repository contains the result of that first learning experience:

- My earliest attempts with HTML and CSS
- The first time I organized and styled content on a webpage
- A reminder of the moment I said, _"Wow, I built this!"_

It may not be much by professional standards, but to me, this site is special.  
It marks the beginning of my coding journey.

## 🚀 Where I Am Now

Thanks to that very first tutorial, I have now become:

- A back-end web developer
- Currently progressing towards becoming a full-stack web developer
- Eager to expand my skills into the exciting fields of AI and Machine Learning

This project reminds me how it all began —  
with **one tutorial, one website, and a whole new world to explore**.
