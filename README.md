# Hello World! 👋🌐

> From a single line of HTML to building my very first website — a journey that began with one YouTube video.

## 📖 The Backstory

In **2021**, I stumbled upon a YouTube tutorial titled **"Belajar HTML Dasar - Membuat Website dari Nol"** by [Dzulfikar Nurfikri](https://youtu.be/86FHw_iJlHM?si=I7zNsOBZD_KO7VQH).  
Out of curiosity, I clicked play... and unknowingly stepped into the world of **web development**.

That tutorial started with the simplest thing: printing `"Hello World"` on the screen using HTML.  
It felt magical — seeing a browser display something that I wrote in code.

From there, the tutorial walked me through:

- Basic HTML structure
- Using headings, paragraphs, lists
- Embedding images and links
- Creating a simple layout

By the end of it, I had my **first actual website**, and it blew my mind.

## 💻 What’s This Repo?

This repository contains the result of that first learning experience:

- My earliest attempts with HTML elements like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`
- The first time I organized content on a page
- A reminder of the moment I said, _"Wow, I built this!"_

It may not be much by professional standards, but to me, this site is special.  
It marks the beginning of my coding journey.

## 🚀 Where I Am Now

Thanks to that very first line of code, I have now become:

- A back-end web developer
- Currently progressing towards becoming a full-stack web developer
- Eager to expand my skills into the exciting fields of AI and Machine Learning

This project reminds me how it all began —  
with **one tutorial, one "Hello World", and a whole new world to explore**.
